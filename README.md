1\. Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases



| Feature              | Flat File System | Relational Database |

|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|

| \*\*Structure\*\*        | Stores all data in one file, usually plain text or CSV. | Stores data in multiple linked tables. |

| \*\*Data Redundancy\*\*  | High – same data may be stored many times. | Low – avoids duplication using keys. |

| \*\*Relationships\*\*    | No built-in relationships. | Uses primary and foreign keys to link tables. |

| \*\*Example Usage\*\*    | Contact lists in CSV files. | Banking systems, online stores. |

| \*\*Drawbacks\*\*        | Hard to update, prone to errors, poor scalability. | Needs setup and management skills. |
